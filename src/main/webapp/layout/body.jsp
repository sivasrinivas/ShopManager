The former CEO of the Italian defence giant Finmeccanica has been freed from jail pending his trial on corruption charges next month.

Giuseppe Orsi was released Saturday after some 80 days in pre-trial detention. He faces charges of paying bribes to secure a 560 million euro ($670 million) deal to sell 12 helicopters to India.

A speedy trial for Orsi, who was head of the Agusta helicopter division at the time of the deal, and his successor Bruno Spagnoli, opens June 19.

Prosecutors allege that the kickbacks were part of the companys philosophy. India also is investigating the deal, and has put future deliveries on hold.

Orsi, who has denied any wrongdoing, was replaced as CEO of the state-controlled company after his arrest.
